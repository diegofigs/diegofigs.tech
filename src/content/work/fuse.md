## Highlights

- Spearheaded the development and implementation of the Trader Joe Analytics fork for the information page, delivering comprehensive metrics to users on their staking returns and helping them make more informed decisions.
- As the architect of the Voltage API, I empowered industry-leading platforms like DeFi Llama and CoinGecko with accurate and up-to-date metrics, strengthening Fuse Network's presence in the DeFi space.
- Led the UI rebranding initiative for the Voltage app, resulting in the retention of over 40 daily active users and an average of more than 200 daily transactions, showcasing the platform's growing popularity and usability.
- Integrated staking TVL (Total Value Locked) metrics to DeFi Llama not only expanded the visibility of Fuse Network's staking solutions but also reinforced our commitment to transparency and data-driven insights in the DeFi ecosystem.

These accomplishments demonstrate my ability to drive innovation, create engaging user experiences, analytics foster collaboration across teams, further solidifying my expertise as a Developer in the DeFi space.
