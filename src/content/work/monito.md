## Overview

I played a crucial role in the development of a news monitoring platform for high-profile clients.

### Digital

I took ownership of the article scraping system, which covered more than 30 media outlets, significantly contributing to the platform's capabilities. My efforts led to the product accounting for over 50% of the client metadata, demonstrating its value and impact.

### Print

I led the development of a product that leveraged Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to retrieve news content, mentoring an intern in the process. My guidance and expertise resulted in a 25% reduction in engineering costs, showcasing efficient resource allocation and cost-effective solutions.

### Insights

By developing trend comparison software, I enabled clients to save an average of one hour daily when drawing conclusions from the gathered data. This improvement highlighted my ability to optimize workflows and deliver meaningful insights to clients, ultimately enhancing their decision-making processes.

## Conclusion

These accomplishments underline my strengths as a Software Engineer, showcasing my commitment to innovation, efficiency, and the successful implementation of tailored solutions for clients across various industries.
