## Overview

These achievements highlight my ability to drive innovation, lead teams, and deliver high-impact solutions tailored to diverse industries and client requirements.

### Snappt

For this financial screening and fraud detection web platform, I introduced a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline that reduced the bug surface rate by over 50%. Additionally, I developed a deployment strategy that led to 42 uninterrupted successful version releases, streamlining logistics and saving approximately one hour per week.

### Walkboard

As a team lead for this moving company project, I managed a team of five developers for eight months, spearheading the development of three tools to support client operations. My efforts resulted in a remarkable 300% improvement in the quote-to-sale conversion times, enhancing efficiency and overall performance.

### Blitz.GG

For this video game coaching platform, I implemented an Electron hybrid app customized for coaching players. I took ownership of the CSGO web and core app components, contributing significantly to the platform's success and user experience.
